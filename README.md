Questions:

1. What is the major difference between an abstract class and an interface?

An abstract class acts as a template which other classes can extend from. It is never instantiated on its own, but its properties are inherited by its child class. An interface is used to add specific functionality to any class. When it's implemented into a class, all it's methods must be as well.The implementing class can then define what happens in the interface's methods. A concrete child classcan only extend one abstract class, but can implement as many methods as it needs.

2. Why is Java 7â€™s class inheritance flawed?

Changes within a superclass, e.g. in subsequent releases, can potentially break a subclass. For example, If a subclass overrides a superclass method but invokes the superclass's method within the overridden one (using super.methodCall(...)), the results of that method may not be as expected.
